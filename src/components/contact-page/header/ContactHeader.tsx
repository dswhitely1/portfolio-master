        <h2>Get in Touch</h2>
        <p>I’d love to hear about what you’re working on and how I could help. I’m currently
            looking for a new role and am open to a wide range of opportunities. My preference
            would be to find a position in a company in Louisville, KY. But I’m also happy to hear about
            opportunities that don’t fit that description. I’m a hard-working and positive person
            who will always approach each task with a sense of purpose and attention to detail.
            Please do feel free to check out my online profiles below and get in touch using the form.</p>
